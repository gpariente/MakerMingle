## Overview

Welcome to our DIY Forum project! This is a platform for DIY (Do it yourself) enthusiasts where you can explore various categories, view projects, add comments, and create new projects. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling in the UI, and NestJS with MongoDB for the API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) (Optional, but recommended for managing MongoDB)

   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/gpariente/MakerMingle)
   ```

2. Navigate to the API directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Navigate to the UI directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../ui
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Start the MongoDB server on your machine.

2. In the API directory, run the following command to start the NestJS server:
   ```bash
